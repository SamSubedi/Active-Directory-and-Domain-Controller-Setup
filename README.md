# Project 1: Active-Directory-and-Domain-Controller-Setup
This project demonstrates the design, deployment, and management of a complete Active Directory (AD) infrastructure in a simulated enterprise environment. It showcases practical skills in domain controller setup, organizational unit (OU) and user management, Group Policy configuration, file server setup, network drive mapping, and PowerShell automation.

Key features include:

- Domain Controller Deployment: Installing Active Directory Domain Services and configuring a new forest/domain.

- OU and User Management: Creating parent and child OUs, adding users, and organizing accounts by department.

- Group and Permission Management: Creating security groups and assigning users to manage access to shared resources.

- File Server Configuration: Setting up RAID-5 volumes, sharing departmental and private folders, and mapping home and shared drives.

- Group Policy Automation: Using GPOs to map network drives and enforce policies for specific OUs.

- PowerShell Automation: Bulk user creation with predefined properties, OU placement, and group membership.

- Troubleshooting Scenarios: Identifying and resolving common issues like login failures, drive mapping errors, and permission conflicts.

This project demonstrates real-world IT administration and support skills, including Active Directory management, secure file sharing, network configuration, and automation. It can serve as a foundation for enterprise system and network administration and is ideal for anyone looking to showcase hands-on experience with Windows Server environments.

# Project 2: Project 2: Exchange Server Deployment and Configuration

# This project demonstrates the deployment, configuration, and validation of Microsoft Exchange Server in an Active Directory based enterprise environment. It builds on the Active Directory and Domain Controller infrastructure by integrating Exchange Server to provide secure internal and external email communication.

# Key features include:

- Exchange Server Preparation: Configuring static IP addressing, server hostname, domain membership, and DNS settings to ensure proper communication with the Domain Controller.

- Prerequisite Configuration: Installing required Windows updates, Exchange prerequisites, and preparing a dedicated storage drive for Exchange databases and logs.

- Exchange Server Installation: Mounting the Exchange Server installation media, running setup with administrative privileges, selecting the Exchange organization name, specifying a custom installation path, and completing the installation process.

- Service Validation: Verifying that all Microsoft Exchange services are running correctly and restarting services if required.

- Web Access Verification: Accessing Exchange Control Panel (ECP) and Outlook Web Access (OWA) to confirm successful deployment and mailbox accessibility.

- Active Directory Integration: Ensuring Exchange Server functionality through proper communication with the Domain Controller for authentication, directory services, and DNS resolution.

This project demonstrates practical experience with enterprise email server deployment, Active Directory integration, DNS configuration, and post-installation verification. It complements the Active Directory project and showcases real-world skills required for system administration, messaging infrastructure management, and enterprise IT support.
