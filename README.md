- PowerShell Automation: Bulk user creation with predefined properties, OU placement, and group membership.

- Troubleshooting Scenarios: Identifying and resolving common issues like login failures, drive mapping errors, and permission conflicts.

This project demonstrates real-world IT administration and support skills, including Active Directory management, secure file sharing, network configuration, and automation. It can serve as a foundation for enterprise system and network administration and is ideal for anyone looking to showcase hands-on experience with Windows Server environments.
